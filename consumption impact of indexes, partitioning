To minimize the consumption impact of DDL operations involving indexes and partitioning, developers should optimize index creation by focusing on selective columns and maintaining index maintenance strategies like rebuilds or reorganization. Implement partitioning to manage large tables and reduce scan times. Use online index operations during low-traffic periods to prevent blocking, and regularly monitor query performance to adjust indexing and partitioning strategies as needed.
