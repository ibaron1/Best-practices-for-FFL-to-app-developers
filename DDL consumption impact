To mitigate DDL consumption impact, minimize blocking by using online schema changes and performing operations during off-peak hours. Ensure proper indexing and partitioning to reduce resource contention. List dependencies like foreign keys, triggers, views, and application logic that rely on the affected tables, and test DDL changes in staging to verify that they don't disrupt dependent objects. Additionally, consider using DDL triggers for tracking changes and ensuring consistency.
