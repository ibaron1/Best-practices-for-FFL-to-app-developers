For DDL historical data migration, app developers should use version-controlled migration scripts to ensure consistency across environments. Leverage bulk data transfer techniques (e.g., SSIS, BCP) for efficient data migration while minimizing system impact. Maintain backward compatibility by carefully managing schema changes and preserving data integrity. Test migrations in staging environments, ensuring that historical data is accurately transferred and accessible post-migration.
