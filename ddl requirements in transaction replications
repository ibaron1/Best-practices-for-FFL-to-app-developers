For DDL requirements in transactional replication, ensure schema changes (e.g., ALTER, DROP, CREATE) are carefully synchronized across Publisher and Subscriber. Avoid making direct DDL changes on replicated tables; use scripts or migration tools instead. Make sure any DDL changes are compatible with replication and do not disrupt ongoing replication processes. Regularly test schema changes in staging before applying them in production.
