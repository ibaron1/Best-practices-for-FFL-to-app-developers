For consumption impact, optimize queries and database objects to minimize resource contention and avoid excessive CPU, memory, or I/O usage. Use indexing, partitioning, and caching to reduce load on production systems. Identify and list dependencies such as foreign keys, triggers, and application logic that rely on specific objects to avoid breaking changes. Regularly monitor system performance and adjust resources based on workload patterns.
