For managing DDL rate of change and growth, developers should implement structured change management using tools like Liquibase or Flyway to version and automate schema changes. Minimize schema changes by using soft-deployment strategies (e.g., incremental changes, non-disruptive DDL) and avoid frequent, large modifications that can affect performance. Monitor database growth patterns and employ partitioning, indexing, and archiving strategies to maintain performance and scalability over time.
