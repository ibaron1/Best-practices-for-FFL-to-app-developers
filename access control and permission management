For access control and permission management in DDL, developers should follow the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions for schema changes. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to assign specific DDL permissions, like ALTER, CREATE, and DROP, to authorized users. Implement audit logging to track and monitor DDL activities and ensure compliance with security policies. Additionally, leverage schema ownership to segregate access to sensitive objects and limit exposure.
