For object change velocity in a database, minimize frequent schema changes (e.g., adding/removing columns, altering constraints) to prevent performance degradation and unnecessary locking. Utilize version control and migration tools (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase) to manage and automate object changes across environments. Test changes in non-production environments to ensure application stability, and ensure backward compatibility to avoid breaking changes that could disrupt functionality.
