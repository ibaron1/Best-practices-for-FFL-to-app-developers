For object change velocity in a database, minimize frequent schema changes (e.g., adding/removing columns, altering constraints) to prevent performance degradation and unnecessary locking. Utilize version control and migration tools (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase) to manage and automate object changes across environments. Test changes in non-production environments to ensure application stability, and ensure backward compatibility to avoid breaking changes that could disrupt functionality.
To mitigate DDL consumption impact, minimize blocking by using online schema changes and performing operations during off-peak hours. Ensure proper indexing and partitioning to reduce resource contention. List dependencies like foreign keys, triggers, views, and application logic that rely on the affected tables, and test DDL changes in staging to verify that they don't disrupt dependent objects. Additionally, consider using DDL triggers for tracking changes and ensuring consistency.
